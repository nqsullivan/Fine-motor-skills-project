# Requirements

1. Final User: Adult stroke patients
2. Problem Statement: Patients who have suffered from a stroke can be lacking in fine motor skill abilities. In order to help stroke patients recover their fine motor skills such as pencil skills, hand eye coordination and self care, we will create a game which will not only help progress their skills but also keep them engaged.
3. Pain points:

- Screen brightness for damaging eyes over time
- Breaks in between sessions
- Adults are learning many other skills all by doing different things
- Adults don&#39;t want their time to be wasted
- Have a busy schedule and not a lot of spare time
- May be discouraged because they have lost a skill they once had
- Rebuilding motor skills takes a lot of time
- Lots of tasks adults are required to do require fine motor skills
- Goals need to be set in place so he/she can feel rewarded by making progress
- Adults do not have the highest attention span so activities need to be really interesting from the start

Questions:

- What are the main motor skills you are struggling with?
- How long have you been having these problems?
- What games and activities are you currently interested in?
- What keeps you engaged?
- How much time do you have each day?
