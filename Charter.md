# Project Description &amp; Objectives

Patients who have suffered from a stroke can be lacking in fine motor skill abilities. The objective of the project is to help stroke patients recover their fine motor skills such as pencil skills, hand eye coordination and self care. Our team objective is to accomplish this by making this recovery process as fast and as fun as possible. We plan to do this by creating a game which will not only help progress their skills but also keep them engaged.

### Functional:

- The program should have different exercises.
- Program should give back feedback to the user.
- The program should help users increase their abilities in the above activities.

### Performance:

- There should be three different exercises.
- Feedback should either be visual, auditory, or both.
- Users&#39; performances in the above activities should increase by 10% in speed and 10% in consistency.

### Constraints:

- The program must be a web based application using p5.js.
- The program must be completed before the due date.

## Project Deliverables

The deliverables of our project will be the app we are creating (finishing and completing design of app), the code on P5JS (Coding ran and tested multiple times and confirmed functional) and the project summaries (Overviews of the project in summaries from each group member). Other deliverables include the several Milestones: Defining the Exercises, Animate Shapes, Interact with Shapes, Interact with Shapes, Quality Assessment. The final deliverable is the demonstration of our application.
