User #1

that my finger was moving and my risk was moving as well

the guitar hero

yes

guitar hero

guitar hero was the hardest and then it is the target practice and finally, it was the line drawn

yes the games were fun to play

yes the feedback was adequate for each game

the difficulty of each game was a little too easy

you guys should have a back to menu options when done with the game.

User #2

1) Throughout all of these games, I would say that they were all fundamentally attention-grabbing. The targets/target count for the first exercise caught my attention; the guitar strings for the second; and the two dots for the third. However, for the first exercise (target practice), I would suggest minimizing the number that represents the target count. It does draw the eye a little more than the targets after the game is initially launched.

2) I preferred the second exercise. It was quite like the actual game.

3) Instructions were except for the third exercise. The line draw could use a comment.

4) The second exercise.

5) The second exercise.

6) All of them were enjoyable.

7) Feedback should include more text/written commentary.

8) Yes, difficulty was adequate.

9) N/A

This is all the feedback we got
