**Most Important Pain Points**

1. Adults do not have the highest attention span so activities need to be engaging from the start
2. Lots of tasks adults are required to do need really precise fine motor skills.
3. Pencil writing skills
4. Repetitive exercises are one of the best ways to regain fine motor skills but can be extremely boring doing the same thing over and over again.
5. Have a hard time coordinating functional tasks (picking up one thing and placing it somewhere). This is one of the most important tasks to be able to perform.
6. Adults have busy lives so they need to get their fine motor skills back fast.
7. Hand eye coordination

**Exercises**

1. Line Drawing
  1. Type of Exercise: Precise movement, requires a straight line to be drawn between points with as little deviation as possible. Focus on accuracy over speed.
  2. Type of human interaction: Mouse, decided on mouse instead of touch to add more complexity
  3. Type of feedback: Visual, once the line is drawn, the user will be presented with how accurate their line was.
  4. Pain points covered: Really precise movements, coordinating functional tasks, pencil writing skills
  5. Description: Research has shown repetitive task specific training is one of the best ways to improve coordination of functional tasks. Having to precisely get your mouse on a small circle then having to create your own path to another point was the best way we could replicate this movement in a digital sense. This exercise also helps with the pain point of really precise movement because not only does the exercise make sure the end points meet but how much the user deviates from a straight line between the circles. This game has an emphasis on accuracy over time, so it&#39;s a great starting point for new users.

1. Guitar Hero
  1. Type of Exercise: Repetitive movement, will only have to click a few keys over and over again to create music.
  2. Type of human interaction: Keyboard
  3. Type of feedback: Visual and audio, the user will be able to see what keys they need to press and once they press the key, they will get audio feedback of what guitar note that key was supposed to represent.
  4. Pain points covered: repetitive movement, engaging, adults have busy lives so need to get their motor skills back fast
  5. Description: Repetitive movements are critical to improving fine motor skills fast, in order to make this repetitive movement more engaging, we have added sound so it isn&#39;t the user just pressing keys but they will be playing music as well. We will have repetitive movements because the user will only need to be pressing four different keys throughout the game.

1. Target Practice
  1. Type of Exercise: Fast precise movement, the user will need to quickly move their mouse to each circle and press it.
  2. Type of human interaction: Mouse, the user will have to move their mouse and click on randomly appearing circles.
  3. Type of feedback: Visual, when the user has completed the exercise, they will show how long it took them and a score out of 5 stars to see improvement.
  4. Pain points covered: engaging, hand eye coordination
  5. Description: To make this game as engaging as possible, we modeled this game after a shooting game where targets appear and you have to shoot them. The main emphasis of this game is hand eye coordination and fast movement. While this is the most advanced game out of the three, it is also the most engaging because of its similarities to shooting games, one of the most popular game genres.
